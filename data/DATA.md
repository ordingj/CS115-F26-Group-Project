# Data Directory — YAML Catalog

This document describes every YAML file in `data/`. Each file is loaded at runtime by
`game.load_yaml_data()` (see `game/__init__.py`). Python source files **never** contain
hardcoded narrative strings; all user-facing text lives here.

## commands.yaml

**Loaded by:** `game/commands/basic_commands.py`, `game/puzzles/bathroom.py`,
`game/puzzles/janitor.py`, `game/commands/player_commands.py`,
`game/commands/player_movement.py`, `game/commands/command.py`, `game/main.py`,
`game/engine/engine.py`, `game/engine/curses_engine.py`, `game/engine/curses_rendering.py`

Static response strings for every player-facing command handler. Strings that require runtime
substitution use Python `str.format()` placeholders (e.g. `{time}`, `{verb}`, `{target}`).
Multi-line values use YAML folded scalars (`>-`), which collapse internal newlines to single
spaces and strip the trailing newline. Literal-block scalars (`|` or `|-`) preserve newlines
exactly.

updates the plain-text labels, curses panel headings, and header prefixes without modifying
Python code.

## rooms.yaml

**Loaded by:** `game/world.py` → `build_world()`

All room definitions. The loader validates required fields, then clones each entry into a
`Room` object (see `game/room.py`). Mutable fields (`exits`, `items`, `attributes`) are
deep-copied on each `build_world()` call so multiple test instances don't share state.

### Room entry structure

```yaml
- room_id: <string> # unique key used throughout the engine
  name: <string> # short display name shown in the UI header/panel
  description: <string> # base room prose; dynamic helpers may append to it at render time
  exits: # directional exit map; value is destination room_id
    forward: <room_id|null|sentinel>
    back: <room_id|null|sentinel>
    left: <room_id|null|sentinel>
    right: <room_id|null|sentinel>
  items: # optional; map of item_id -> display name
    <item_id>: <string>
  attributes: # optional; arbitrary key/value pairs for game logic
    <key>: <value>
  type: structural | flavor # used to build FLAVOR_ROOM_POOL
```

### Exit values

| Value                       | Meaning                                                           |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<room_id>`                 | Normal exit to the named room.                                    |
| `null`                      | Direction exists but leads nowhere (blocked or wired at runtime). |
| `__lobby_forward_blocked__` | Sentinel — displays `responses.move.lobby_forward_blocked`.       |
| `__lobby_back_blocked__`    | Sentinel — displays `responses.move.lobby_back_blocked`.          |

Exits marked `null` in this file are wired dynamically by puzzle routing logic in
`game/player_movement.py` each time the player enters a puzzle room.

### Room types

| Type         | Description                                                                  |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `structural` | Part of the critical path; always present in the world.                      |
| `flavor`     | Wrong-way detour room; sampled randomly into the wrong-way chain at runtime. |

### Structural rooms (critical path)

| `room_id`                | Display name       | Notes                                                                                                                                                                        |

| `hallway_approach`       | Detour Hallway     | On entry, both directions are rewired through 1–3 sampled detour rooms before 4-way; randomized detours prefer unused flavor rooms until the eligible pool is exhausted.     |
| `intersection_4way`      | 4-Way Intersection | **Step 1 puzzle node.** Exits wired at runtime; the correct exit now feeds 1–3 rooms before the first 3-way, and return-only reset text comes from `attributes.return_text`. |
| `intersection_3way`      | 3-Way Junction     | Restroom junction: `forward` leads to the bathroom, `back` returns to the 4-way; side halls are rewired on entry from the same non-repeating detour pool.                    |
| `bathroom`               | Restroom           | **Step 2 puzzle node.** Hand-washing mini-puzzle.                                                                                                                            |
| `intersection_3way_exit` | 3-Way Junction     | Post-bathroom junction; mirror-correct exit rewired through 1–3 rooms before janitor, still preferring unused flavor rooms first.                                            |
| `hallway_janitor`        | Janitor's Hallway  | **Step 3/4 puzzle node.** Janitor song clue; the correct exit is rewired through 1–3 rooms before Final Stretch, still preferring unused flavor rooms first.                 |
| `hallway_final`          | Final Stretch      | Linear path from the last detour chain to the win room.                                                                                                                      |
| `room_314`               | Room 314           | Win condition. Setting `is_win_room: true`.                                                                                                                                  |

### Flavor rooms (wrong-way pool)

Flavor rooms are sampled randomly by `player_movement.build_room_entry_handlers()` to build
interstitial detour chains between puzzle nodes. The sampler tracks which flavor rooms have
already appeared in randomized detours during the current play-through and only recycles an
older room when the current eligible unused pool runs out.

## events.yaml

**Loaded by:** `game/event.py` → `load_events()`

Ambient narrative events that fire automatically based on game state. The `EventQueue` checks
every registered event after each player action and prints the `message` of the first event
whose `condition` evaluates to `True`.

### Event entry structure

```yaml
- event_id: <string>     # unique identifier
  message: <string>      # text printed to the player when the event fires
  condition:             # declarative condition spec (see below)
    type: <condition_type>
    ...
```

### Condition types

| `type`            | Additional fields     | Evaluates to `True` when…                   |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `time_range`      | `gt: int`, `lte: int` | `gt < state.time_remaining <= lte`          |
| `move_count_eq`   | `value: int`          | `state.move_count == value`                 |
| `move_count_gte`  | `value: int`          | `state.move_count >= value`                 |
| `location`        | `room_id: str`        | `state.current_room_id == room_id`          |
| `wrong_turns_gte` | `value: int`          | `state.wrong_turns >= value`                |
| `all`             | `conditions: list`    | All sub-conditions are `True` (logical AND) |

Sub-conditions inside `all` use the same type/field structure as top-level conditions.

## puzzle.yaml

**Loaded by:** `game/puzzles/intersection.py`, `game/puzzles/bathroom_view.py`

Narrative text templates for the three-step puzzle clue system. All values are folded scalars
(`>-`) that resolve to a single paragraph string.

### `step1_clue_templates`

Keyed by **clue type**. The correct direction for Step 1 is chosen randomly by
`intersection.step1_roll()` from `"forward"`, `"left"`, or `"right"`. The clue type is also
chosen randomly from the keys of this section.

Placeholder tokens:

| Token        | Substituted with                                                  |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `{correct}`  | The correct direction (e.g. `"left"`).                            |
| `{opposite}` | The opposite direction (e.g. `"right"` when correct is `"left"`). |

| Clue type key | Visual device                                                       |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `light`       | A flickering fluorescent light marks the correct hallway.           |
| `sign`        | An orange CS-club flyer with an arrow points the correct way.       |
| `shadow`      | A fleeting shadow slips around the corner in the correct direction. |

### `step1_readable_targets`

Alternate `READ` targets keyed by Step 1 clue type.

| Key    | Description                                                        |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `sign` | Accepts `flyer`, `orange flyer`, and `bake sale flyer` as aliases. |

### `step2_direction_prefix`

Short prefix prepended to the Step 2 direction before it is reversed for the mirror clue.

### `step2_mirror_text`

A single folded-scalar string. Used by `puzzle.step2_mirror_text()`. The correct direction for
Step 2 is the exit direction from `intersection_3way_exit` that leads into the 1–3 room
approach chain toward the janitor hallway, seeded by `puzzle.step2_roll()`.

Placeholder tokens:

| Token         | Substituted with                                                         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `{backwards}` | The direction string reversed character-by-character (e.g. `"TFEL OG"`). |
| `{direction}` | The correct direction in uppercase (e.g. `"LEFT"`).                      |

## songs.yaml

**Loaded by:** `game/puzzle.py` → `step3_roll()` (via `game.load_yaml_data()`)

The pool of songs the janitor hums. Step 3 (`step3_roll()`) randomly picks one entry from this
list; its `direction` value becomes `state.active_clues["step3_correct_dir"]` and its `chorus`
is printed when the player types `LISTEN` in the janitor's hallway.

### Entry structure

```yaml
- direction: left | right # the direction word hidden in this song
  title: <string> # song title (shown as a header line when listening)
  chorus: | # literal-block scalar; exact chorus lyrics
    <line 1>
    <line 2>
    ...
```

### `direction` values

| Value   | Meaning                       |
| ------- | ----------------------------- |
| `left`  | The Step 3 answer is `LEFT`.  |
| `right` | The Step 3 answer is `RIGHT`. |

> **Note:** `forward` and `back` are intentionally absent from the song pool. The Step 3
> direction is constrained to `left` or `right` so the janitor's lyrical clue is unambiguous.
